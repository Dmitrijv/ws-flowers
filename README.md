# Will & Skill Interview Task

![preview](readme/start.png)

In this task I developed a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app for people with a botanical interest using a Flower API provided by Will&Skil. The app consist of three pages: a landing page with a flower gallery, a flower details page and a seasons page. Flower gallery uses [Masonry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-masonry-css) library for React.

It's possible to leave comments when browsing flower details pages. Functions for interaction with the comment API are collected in JSX Kit called [CommentKit](pages/data/CommentKit.js).
